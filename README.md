# Overview of the Project

With the tremendous amounts of data being generated in today’s world, it becomes important to understand the evolution of topics over time. Understanding topic evolution can aid people in professions such as politics, data analytics and academia gain knowledge of evolving trends and make decisions based on that knowledge. WordStream introduces a novel technique of performing this task. It combines two popular visualizations: stream graph and word cloud. 

In addition to the base system there have two extensions:
1. We show similar words across topics for each year by the use of a force-directed graph layout. This layout algorithm places the more interconnected terms together allowing for cluster patterns to implicitly emerge. 
2. We are also displaying a stacked bar chart upon the click of each word with finer details about the word over time. 

With these two extensions in place, we hope to make WordStream an even more powerful tool to allow the user to gain insights on large textual datasets.

**Technologies Used**: ReactJS, D3, Bootstrap, Python.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
